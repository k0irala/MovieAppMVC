The Movie App is a web-based application developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework, 
designed to manage a collection of movies and their corresponding genres. 
The application follows the Model-View-Controller architecture,
ensuring a clear separation between data, user interface, and control logic. 
To optimize performance and maintain database efficiency, movie and genre data are fetched using stored procedures,
which are executed through the Entity Framework’s raw SQL execution methods. 
These stored procedures return movie and genre lists, which are then mapped to their respective models. 
For other operations such as creating, updating, and deleting movie records, the application leverages LINQ to Entities, 
enabling expressive and maintainable data manipulation. The Movie model includes attributes like Title, ReleaseDate, and GenreId, 
while the Genre model consists of Id and Name. The application uses view models to combine data from both entities when displaying content in views. 
Users can perform CRUD operations through intuitive forms, with dropdowns dynamically populated using stored procedure results.
The combination of stored procedures for read operations and LINQ for write operations strikes a balance between performance optimization and developer productivity, 
making the application both efficient and easy to maintain.
